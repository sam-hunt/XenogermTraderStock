# Release

Prepare and publish a new release for Xenogerm Trader Stock — either a stable
release or a release candidate.

**Release candidates** (`X.Y.Z-rc.N`) are private test builds: a tagged GitHub
prerelease whose zip can be tried on another machine without building from
source. They never go to the Steam Workshop and get no `CHANGELOG.md` section.
Otherwise an RC is held to the same bar as a stable release (it should be what
would ship), so it runs every step below except the changelog and the
Workshop paste. SemVer orders `1.0.4 < 1.1.0-rc.1 < 1.1.0-rc.2 < 1.1.0`, so
candidates sit between stable versions without disturbing them.

`$ARGUMENTS` is optional and resolved at step 7, where the version is first
needed. From a stable version: a bump type (`major`, `minor`, `patch`),
optionally followed by `rc`. From an RC version: `promote` (to the stable
version) or `rc` (the next candidate). Ask for whatever is missing.

"The last stable tag" below means the newest tag with no prerelease suffix —
`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --exclude '*-*'`. Every range in this skill
measures from it, never from an RC tag, so a stable release's changelog and
Workshop diff cover everything since the previous stable release.

## Current state

!`grep -o '<modVersion>[^<]*' About/About.xml | sed 's/<modVersion>/About.xml version: /'`
!`git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --exclude '*-*' 2>/dev/null || echo "no stable tags found"`
!`git -c versionsort.suffix=- tag -l 'v*-*' --sort=-v:refname | head -3`
!`git log "$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --exclude '*-*' 2>/dev/null || echo 'HEAD~10')..HEAD" --oneline --no-merges`

## Steps

Work through the steps below in order. Steps 1-6 are validation and may
generate their own commits, which is exactly why the release decision —
version, changelog, tag — happens once, at step 7, after everything that can
still change the history. Confirmations: the conditional translation commits
in steps 3-4 each get a diff review, and step 7 is the single release gate;
nothing else asks.

**Promoting an RC with nothing committed since its tag** (`git log
<rc-tag>..HEAD` is empty): the candidate already validated this exact tree, but
the world may have moved since (an upstream l10n release, a vanilla update
changing inherited text), so steps 2-3 always run. If step 3 commits nothing, skip
steps 4-6 and go straight to step 7 — say so. If it does commit (a pin bump,
a sidecar or translation change), the tree is no longer the one the candidate
validated: run the full sequence. Any other commit since the RC tag means the
full run.

### 1. Review changes

The commit log since the last stable tag is shown above — read it now to understand
what this release contains. If the repo has no tags yet this is the first
release: use the full history (`git log --oneline --no-merges`) and think in
terms of the mod's shipped feature set rather than a diff. No confirmation —
this is orientation, not a decision.

### 2. Tests and build gate

Run, in order:
```bash
dotnet test Tests/1.6/XenogermTraderStock.Tests.csproj
dotnet build XenogermTraderStock.sln -c Release
```

- Both projects set `TreatWarningsAsErrors`, so the build is also the lint
  gate: any compiler or analyzer warning fails it, and a passing build means
  there is nothing warnings-only left in the log to read out.
- This runs before the game boots in steps 3 and 6 because it takes seconds
  and fails fast; a broken tree must not reach the translation commits.
- On any failure, stop and help the user fix it, then rerun until both pass.
  No confirmation on success.

### 3. Refresh translation expectations and check freshness

Run, in order:
```bash
l10n/tools/bump-consumer.sh   # pin l10n to its latest release tag (commits; no-op when current)
python3 Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py
python3 Scripts/check-translations.py --strict
```

- The first command is one of the three moments the l10n pin moves (release,
  translation-pass start, new upstream major); the checker's `--strict`
  engine-pin check fails until the pin is on the latest tag. It commits the
  pointer directly; report its one-line result. If it reports a **MAJOR**
  bump, stop: upstream changed the shim/flow contract and this repo owes the
  accompanying edit before the release continues.
- The refresh script refuses to start while RimWorld is already open (it
  needs an exclusive boot for the mod-list swap). If it reports that, **stop
  and ask the user** to close the client, and rerun only after they confirm
  it is free.
- The first command regenerates `Scripts/expected-injections.json` by
  launching the local RimWorld client with `-l10nprobe` (graphical boot,
  ~1-2 min; the L10nProbe dev mod dumps every DefInjected key the live game
  expects, then quits). This is what surfaces vanilla-inherited and
  C#-default strings a def-XML scan cannot see. Report its diff summary.
- If the diff shows **added or changed keys**, translate them in every
  language now (the `translate` skill's update pass), then rerun the checker.
- Report the per-language checker result (missing keys, stale entries,
  errors). CI's release gate runs the same script without `--strict` against
  the checked-in sidecar; the stricter local run surfaces warnings while
  there is still time to act on them.
- If the sidecar or any translations changed, commit them as their own
  l10n commit (show the diff and **ask the user to confirm**) before moving
  on — the release commit at step 8 stages only the version-bump files.
  Pick the prefix by what the change means to players: `fix(l10n)` for
  drift in content a previous release already shipped (strings players
  could see untranslated or stale), `feat(l10n)` for strings belonging to a
  feature that has not shipped yet (nothing was broken, the feature's work
  was just unfinished). Translations are player-facing, so never `chore`;
  only a sidecar-only regen with no translation change is a `chore(l10n)`.

### 4. Refresh Steam Workshop page translations

The Workshop title and description live in
`.steamworkshop/Description/<Language>.txt` — line 1 is the title, then a
blank line, then the BBCode description; one file per language folder in
`1.6/Languages/`, English being the source of truth (see
`.steamworkshop/README.md`).

- Diff the English source against the last stable release:
  ```bash
  git diff $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --exclude '*-*') -- .steamworkshop/Description/English.txt
  ```
  If an earlier RC of this version already translated the change, the
  language files will already match — check before spawning anyone.
- Also check for languages in `1.6/Languages/` with no description file yet.
- If nothing changed and no file is missing, say so and move on.
- Otherwise spawn one translation subagent per affected language (cheaper
  model, in parallel) to update or create its file, grounded in the
  `translate` skill's glossary section for that language and the mod's own
  committed `1.6/Languages/<Language>/` strings, preserving BBCode tags and
  the title-line format. Subagents never commit.
- Review the diffs, then commit them as their own `docs:` commit (show the
  diff and **ask the user to confirm**).

### 5. Build and deploy

Run:
```bash
dotnet clean XenogermTraderStock.sln
dotnet build XenogermTraderStock.sln -c Release
```

Report the build result. If the build fails, stop and help the user fix it.
On success, move straight to the smoke test - no confirmation.

### 6. Startup smoke test

Run (game closed - the script refuses while RimWorld is open, same as the
refresh in step 3; if it reports that, **stop and ask the user** to close the
client and rerun):

```bash
python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py
```

- Boots the freshly deployed build once on its pinned minimal list (no
  optional integrations) - a clean-startup-log gate (graphical boot,
  ~1-2 min, auto-quits), then classifies every Player.log error by origin and
  fails on anything attributed to this mod (see CLAUDE.md's Testing
  section).
- On PASS, report the summary line and move on - no confirmation. On FAIL,
  show the gated error blocks and **stop** - the release does not proceed
  until the errors are fixed or the user explicitly waives them. Third-party
  (`other`) errors are reported but not gating; mention them so the user can
  judge.

### 7. Version, changelog, and the single release confirmation

Everything that can change history has now run, so the release contents are
final. Do all of the following, then present it as **one** confirmation:

- Read the current version from `About/About.xml` (`<modVersion>`) and
  resolve the new version (from `$ARGUMENTS`, or ask now):
  - **Current is stable** (`1.0.4`): apply the bump type, then either stable
    (`1.1.0`) or the first candidate (`1.1.0-rc.1`).
  - **Current is an RC** (`1.1.0-rc.1`): either promote (`1.1.0`) or cut the
    next candidate (`1.1.0-rc.2`). A bump type doesn't apply here; if the
    user gives one anyway, ask what they mean (a different target version
    abandons the current candidate line).
  - Before an RC, confirm its tag doesn't already exist (`git tag -l`).
- **Stable releases only — the changelog.** An RC skips this bullet group
  entirely: no section, no link reference.
  - Draft changelog notes from the full log since the last stable tag —
    including any commits steps 3-4 just created — grouped by category
    (Fixes, Features, Polish/Other), omitting chore/version-bump commits.
    When promoting, this spans every candidate: a fix for a bug that was
    introduced and fixed within the candidate line never reached Workshop
    users, so fold it into the entry it corrects or drop it.
  - Each changelog entry is a short one-liner fit for Steam Workshop change
    notes (see the note atop `CHANGELOG.md`).
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md`: new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section at the top,
    directly below the Keep a Changelog intro paragraph, using today's date
    (this changelog carries no `[Unreleased]` heading; don't add one), Keep a
    Changelog style (`### Added`, `### Fixed`, ...), plus a
    `[X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/sam-hunt/XenogermTraderStock/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`
    link reference at the bottom of the file, above any older ones.
- Bump the version strings in both files:
  - `About/About.xml` `<modVersion>`: the full version, suffix included
    (`1.1.0-rc.1`). The game treats it as a display-only string, so testers
    with the Workshop copy also subscribed can tell the two apart.
  - `Source/1.6/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`: `AssemblyInformationalVersion`
    gets the same full version; `AssemblyVersion` and `AssemblyFileVersion`
    stay four-part numeric `X.Y.Z.0` with no suffix (they can't hold one), so
    they are identical across every candidate and the stable release.
- Show the user, together: current version → new version (and bump type, or
  RC / promotion), the changelog notes (stable only), the full diff of the
  changed files, and exactly what step 8 will do (rebuild, commit
  `chore: Bump version to <version>`, tag `v<version>`, push with tags).
- **Ask the user to confirm — this is the only release confirmation.** On
  edits, apply them and re-show only what changed.

### 8. Rebuild, commit, tag, push

No further questions unless something is unexpected:

- Rebuild (`dotnet clean XenogermTraderStock.sln && dotnet build XenogermTraderStock.sln -c Release`)
  so the deployed DLL carries the bumped `AssemblyVersion`. Stop on failure.
- Stage only the release files: `About/About.xml`,
  `Source/1.6/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`, and (stable only) `CHANGELOG.md`.
  If other tracked files are modified, list them and ask whether to include
  them (the one conditional exception).
- Commit with message: `chore: Bump version to <version>`
- Tag with: `v<version>`
- Push: `git push && git push --tags`
- Show `git log --oneline -3` and
  `git -c versionsort.suffix=- tag -l 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -5` (the
  config puts each candidate *below* its stable; git's default ranks it above).
- **RC:** that's it. The tag-triggered workflow marks any suffixed tag as a
  GitHub prerelease (never "Latest") with a stub body plus the auto-generated
  commit list, and attaches `XenogermTraderStock-v<version>.zip`. Point the
  user at the release page for the zip, and remind them it's publicly
  downloadable but must not be uploaded to the Workshop.
- **Stable:** also show the changelog notes for the user to copy into the
  **Steam Workshop** description. The **GitHub** release notes need no paste:
  the tag-triggered workflow lifts this version's `CHANGELOG.md` section into
  the release body itself (and hard-fails the release if the section is
  missing), so the changelog entry written at step 7 is the release body. List
  every `.steamworkshop/Description/` file changed since the last stable tag
  (`git diff --name-only <last-stable-tag> -- .steamworkshop/Description/`),
  not only those step 4 just touched: an earlier RC may already have committed
  them, and the Workshop page has seen none of it. Remind the user to paste
  each listed title and description into the Workshop page's per-language edit
  UI (Steam's own language names differ: schinese, koreana, brazilian, latam,
  ...).
