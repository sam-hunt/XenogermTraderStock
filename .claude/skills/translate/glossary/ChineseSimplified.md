# Simplified Chinese — Xenogerm Trader Stock glossary

Family-shared mechanics (RimWorld's `ChineseSimplified` language folder,
full-width punctuation, curly-quote conventions), and vanilla-grounded
common vocabulary (quality tiers, "Traders will pay more for it.") live in
the `l10n/` submodule at `l10n/languages/ChineseSimplified.md`, grounded
across the weapon-mod sibling family's 2026-07 generation. This file holds
only what is specific to Xenogerm Trader Stock.

## Workshop title

`XTS_SettingsCategory` = **贸易商异种胚芽库存** ("traders' xenogerm stock"),
built from the grounded 贸易商 (trader) and 异种胚芽 (xenogerm) plus 库存
(stock/inventory) to render the mod's "xenogerms in traders' stock" sense.
Short, searchable on either keyword, no English brand appended.

## Phrasing decisions

- **"archite gene(s)"** has no single vanilla-attested compound string;
  built by composing `GeneCategoryDef Archite.label`=超凡 with `Gene`=基因,
  following the same compounding pattern vanilla itself uses for
  `ArchiteMetabolism.label`=超凡代谢. Flagged for native review, though the
  compositional grounding is solid.
- **"naturalized" (retired 2026-11-11):** the English no longer uses the term, so the earlier flagged rendering is gone from every file.
- **"ideology" (recognition)** — rendered as 文化 (bare noun, ideoligion),
  matching the family's Ideology DLC grounding (`ButtonShowAllIdeoligions`
  etc. use 文化); no dedicated Ideology vanilla data was pulled for this
  pass since the mod only references the concept in passing prose.
- **"germline xenotypes"** in `XTS_IncludeInheritableDesc` is rendered as
  系谱异种人 (from `Endogenes`=系谱基因) rather than repeating 可遗传, to
  distinguish the parenthetical restatement from the setting's own label
  (可遗传异种人) while keeping both terms transparently linked.
- Colon usage follows the family style file: ASCII `: ` in label/value
  templates (`XTS_BasePresetValue`=预设基础价值: {0}, all `Default: {0}`
  descriptions), full-width ： nowhere in this mod's terse templates, and
  plain prose sentences in the Workshop description use no colon except
  where mirroring the English's own `Q:`/`A:` and bulleted `[b]Label[/b] - `
  slots (kept as literal ASCII ` - ` per the brief's exception).
- No new dashes introduced beyond the two English-mirrored ` - ` slots
  (Mod Settings list, Links line) that the brief explicitly permits.
- **"Scenario" corrected from 场景 to 剧本 (2026-09-02 pass).** The prior
  (now-deleted) `XTS_IncludePlayerScenarioDesc` rendered scenario editor as
  "场景编辑器", but the Biotech/Core vanilla tar grounds "scenario" as 剧本
  throughout (`ScenarioEditor`=剧本编辑器, `ScenariosCustom`=自定义,
  `ScenarioTitle`=标题). All new scenario-related keys in this pass
  (`XTS_FilterPlayerScenario(Desc)`, `XTS_CustomXenotypeDesc`,
  `XTS_XenotypeSourceScenario`) use 剧本; no lingering 场景 usages remain
  after this pass since the only prior occurrences were in the deleted keys.
- **2026-09-02 update pass:** added 42 new keys (xenotypes-for-sale filter
  rows, price-breakdown tooltip lines, quantity/implantation/commonality
  sections), retranslated the 4 pricing slider tooltips whose trailing
  "Default: {0}" clause was dropped from English, and deleted the
  Include-Archite/Inheritable/PlayerScenario keys (superseded by the
  per-xenotype sold ledger and grid). "Custom xenotype" flagged as a
  compositional coinage (no single vanilla string); everything else is
  grounded 1:1 against the Biotech/Core zh tar.
- **2026-11-11 update pass (English reword f019544, machine-assisted, native review pending):** the English dropped its modder vocabulary ("endogenes", "pawn", "commonality", "trader kind", "rolled", "naturalized"), so this pass retranslated the 26 affected keys and the Workshop bullets. Decisions, superseding anything above: rarity = 稀有度 (no vanilla label; replaces 常见度; section header 稀有度取决于价格); person = 人/这个人 (Biotech `ForceXenogermImplantationDesc`); toggle tooltips use 启用后，... 禁用后，...; avoid stacked 的 in the market-value tooltips.
