# .steamworkshop

Publishing metadata for the mod's Steam Workshop page. Nothing in this folder
ships with the mod (the StageMod manifest never matches it) or is loaded by
RimWorld. A `Media/` folder for Workshop images can live here later.

## Description/

One file per language, named after the RimWorld language folders in
`1.6/Languages/`. English is the source of truth; the others are
machine-assisted first passes pending native review. Format:

- Line 1: the Workshop title for that language
- Line 2: blank
- Rest: the BBCode description

Title convention: just as the English title leans on vanilla vocabulary
("Xenogerm" and "Traders") so players searching for either term find the mod,
every localized title must lean on that language's vanilla-localized Biotech
term for xenogerm (Xenokeim, ксеногерм, 异种基因组, ...) and its ordinary word
for traders. Titles are fully localized with no English brand appended:
Workshop search is language-agnostic (any language's title matches regardless
of UI language, verified 2026-08-12) and the preview thumbnail already
carries the English name. Each title must equal that language's
`XTS_SettingsCategory` Keyed value so the in-game settings header matches the
Workshop page (see the CLAUDE.md localization note).

Steam has no API for per-language Workshop text, so updated files are pasted
manually into the Workshop page's edit UI (note Steam's own language names
differ: schinese, koreana, brazilian, latam, ...). The `release` skill diffs
`English.txt` against the last stable release tag and refreshes the translations
whenever it changed.

All nine roster languages (see CONTRIBUTING.md) have a description file as of
the 2026-08-26 machine-assisted pass, refreshed 2026-09-02 against the release
rewrite of `English.txt`; every non-English file is machine-assisted and
pending native review.
