# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving Xenogerm Trader Stock! Bug reports,
suggestions and pull requests are welcome.

If you work in Claude Code, the repo ships a Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/sync-mod.sh`,
wired by `.claude/settings.json`) that rebuilds and redeploys the mod into your
RimWorld Mods folder after any turn that changed mod files. It does nothing when no
RimWorld install is found. Like any script in a repo you clone, read it before you
let an agent run it.

## Localization

The mod targets the languages below, chosen by RimWorld's per-language
audience size. Contributions for any other language RimWorld supports are
welcome too. See "Contributing a translation" below for the conventions to
follow.

| Language             | Status           | Credit  |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| English              | Source           | —       |
| Simplified Chinese   | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| Russian              | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| Korean               | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| German               | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| Spanish              | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| French               | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| Brazilian Portuguese | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| Japanese             | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |
| Traditional Chinese  | Machine-assisted | Fable 5 |

Statuses: **Source** (the authoritative English strings), **Machine-assisted**
(generated with terminology grounded against the official RimWorld
localization; awaiting native review), **Native** (written or reviewed by a
native speaker), **Planned** (not started — contributions welcome).

### Contributing a translation

- Files live under `1.6/Languages/<Language>/` (`Keyed/` and `DefInjected/`),
  mirroring the structure of `1.6/Languages/English/`.
- Every translated entry carries the current English source in a comment
  directly above it, e.g. `<!-- EN: Reset to defaults -->` — this is how stale
  translations are detected when the English changes.
- Placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`, ...) must match the English exactly.
- This mod ships no Defs of its own — only XML Patches — so there is no
  DefInjected content to translate yet. All strings currently live in
  `1.6/Languages/English/Keyed/XTS_UI.xml`, keyed with the `XTS_` prefix.
- Formatting: UTF-8 without BOM, LF line endings, 2-space indent.
- Validate before opening a PR:

  ```bash
  python3 Scripts/check-translations.py --strict
  ```

  It checks key coverage, placeholders, DefInjected paths, staleness, and
  file hygiene. The checker's engine lives in the `l10n/` git submodule, so
  clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules` (or run
  `git submodule update --init` in an existing clone) before validating.

- Improving a machine-assisted language? Corrections from native speakers
  are gladly merged, no matter how small.
