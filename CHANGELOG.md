## [1.0.4] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Stock quantity settings now tell the orbital and caravan exotic goods traders apart instead of showing two identically named rows.
- Xenogerms appear in trader stock again with GTG Trader Core installed.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Dev-mode tool to rebuild a pawn's genes as a chosen scenario xenotype; repairs pawns affected by the fix below.

### Fixed

- Xenogerms for a scenario's own inheritable xenotype now implant into the germline, so the pawn is recognised as that xenotype and its children inherit it.
- Trader-sold xenogerms for scenario xenotypes are priced like preset xenogerms instead of base value.
- Ideoligions with a preferred custom germline xenotype now accept xenogerms for that xenotype.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Xenogerms copied by ReSplice: Core's duplicator retain their xenotype identity on implantation.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Ideoligions with a preferred xenotype no longer refuse xenogerms for that very xenotype.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-02

Initial release.

### Added

- Orbital exotic goods traders sell ready-made xenogerms for preset xenotypes.
- Implanting one assigns the real xenotype, so ideology recognition works.
- Inheritable xenotypes can be implanted into the germline, so children inherit them.
- Baseliner xenogerms, for converting a pawn back to baseliner.
- Deathrest capacity now survives implantation instead of resetting to 1.
- Modded and player-scenario xenotypes are detected and sold automatically.
- Settings for pricing, per-xenotype availability, spawn rarity, and stock counts.
- Compatible with Gene Trader; VRE Android xenotypes are excluded.
- Nine translations: Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), French, German, Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Spanish.
