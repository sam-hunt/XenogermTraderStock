# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Xenogerm Trader Stock** is a RimWorld 1.6 mod that adds xenogerms for preset xenotypes to trader inventories, allowing players to purchase pre-made xenogerms as an alternative to collecting individual genes. Requires the Biotech DLC.

**Key Features:**

- Preset xenogerms added to orbital exotic goods trader inventories
- Proper xenotype assignment on implantation (not just gene copying)
- Weighted spawn rates based on xenogerm cost
- Configurable pricing formula via mod settings
- Gene Trader mod compatibility

**Key Technologies:** C# (.NET Framework 4.7.2), Harmony library, RimWorld modding API, XML patches

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the mod (outputs to 1.6/Assemblies/ and deploys to RimWorld Mods folder)
dotnet build XenogermTraderStock.sln -c Release

# Build only the main project
dotnet build Source/1.6/XenogermTraderStock.csproj

# Full clean rebuild
dotnet clean XenogermTraderStock.sln && dotnet build XenogermTraderStock.sln -c Release

# Run the test suite (native; vstest hosts the net472 suite via mono)
dotnet test Tests/1.6/XenogermTraderStock.Tests.csproj
```

The build system auto-detects the RimWorld installation path on Windows/Linux/Mac (including WSL targeting a Windows install). For CI builds without RimWorld installed, it falls back to the `Krafs.Rimworld.Ref` NuGet package.

### Deployment

The repo lives in `~/dev/XenogermTraderStock`, separate from the RimWorld Mods folder. The csproj's `StageMod` target is the **single source of truth** for what files ship: its ItemGroup feeds both the post-build local deploy (`DeployToModFolder` → `StageMod`, an atomic wipe+recopy of `$RIMWORLD_PATH/Mods/XenogermTraderStock/`, so renamed/deleted files never linger) and the CI release, which invokes the same target with `-p:StageDir=...` so the release zip cannot drift from local deploys. Add/remove shipped files only in that ItemGroup.

A machine-local Claude Code Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/sync-mod.sh`, untracked) rebuilds and redeploys after any turn that touched mod files, so the deployed copy stays fresh without manual builds. Its `find` watch list must cover every content root `StageMod` ships (root, any version folder, and the compat roots `Mods/` and `*/Mods/`), or edits under a missed root silently stop redeploying.

**WSL Setup:** Requires `RIMWORLD_PATH` env var in `~/.bashrc` pointing to the Windows RimWorld install (e.g., `/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/RimWorld`). The csproj auto-detects `RimWorldWin64_Data` when the Linux data folder isn't found.

## Architecture

### Entry Point

`Source/1.6/Core/XenogermTraderStockMod.cs` — `XenogermTraderStockMod` constructor loads settings and patches via `Harmony.PatchAll()` attribute discovery.

**Patch-timing hazard (other mods' methods):** that `PatchAll()` runs from the `Mod` subclass constructor — BEFORE any defs are loaded. Applying a detour JIT-compiles the target and runs its declaring type's static ctor, so a patch targeting ANOTHER MOD's method can permanently break that mod when its cctor resolves defs (the BetterTradersGuild v1.1.0 CWTL incident). The current patch targets vanilla `GeneUtility` (safe); before ever adding a foreign-target patch, defer its application until after defs load — worked example: BetterTradersGuild's `Core/DeferredModPatches.cs`.

**Settings Access:** `XenogermTraderStockMod.Settings` provides global access to mod configuration.

**Settings window (family pattern):** `XenogermTraderStockSettings` is a partial class split across `Core/Settings/Settings_*.cs`, one file per section owning its fields, `Expose*Settings`, `Reset*Settings` and `Draw*Section`; the frame file holds `DoWindowContents`, the fan-outs and the shared `SectionHeader` / `SliderRow` helpers. Help text is hover-tooltip only (section descriptions ride on the medium-font header) — no always-visible tiny-font sub-labels. Adding a setting is a one-file edit; a new section is a new file plus three one-line calls in the frame.

### .claude layout

`.gitignore` tracks only `.claude/skills/` (shared: `release`, `translate`, `rimworld-logs`); `.claude/hooks/` and `.claude/settings.local.json` (Stop-hook wiring, permissions) stay machine-local.

### Core Mechanism

The mod stores a `XenotypeDef` reference on trader-sold xenogerms via `CompXenotypeSource`. When implanted, a Harmony postfix patch on `GeneUtility.ImplantXenogermItem` calls `SetXenotypeDirect()` and nulls `iconDef`, leaving the gene tracker's identity fields (`xenotype`, `xenotypeName`, `iconDef`) exactly as `PawnGenerator` leaves them for a generated pawn of that xenotype (vanilla only copies genes, display name, and the item's icon — which `Xenogerm.ExposeData` backfills to the custom-xenotype `Basic` icon on load). `hybrid` is untouched on this path (a xenogene-layer implant does not change the germline) but cleared by the germline retarget, which leaves the germline uniformly one xenotype — the flag is read for gene inheritance and by the `CustomXenotype` matcher, so a stale `true` has real effects.

**Identity resolution (`XenogermIdentity`):** the implant stamp and the ideology gate never read `CompXenotypeSource` directly — they ask `XenogermIdentity.Resolve`, which returns a `XenogermSource` (a preset `XenotypeDef`, a `CustomXenotype` template, or `None` = nothing loaded claims the gene set; `Inheritable`, not the kind, decides the retarget): the comp's def when set, otherwise *inferred* from the gene set (`GenesMatch`, vanilla's `PawnIsCustomXenotype` rule: `passOnDirectly=false` genes ignored on both sides), custom templates before presets. Inference exists because comp state does not survive every path an item takes: ReSplice Core's xenogerm duplicator rebuilds its copy with `ThingMaker.MakeThing` and copies only `xenotypeName`/`iconDef`/genes, so a duplicated Hussar germ used to implant as a custom "hussar" (same genes, no ideology recognition, no germline retarget). Gene set first, name as tie-breaker only: two templates (by name) or two loaded presets (by label/defName) sharing one gene list are split by `xenotypeName` — or the comp's `sourceCustomName` when set — case-insensitively, and an unbreakable tie resolves to `None` (vanilla behaviour). Name-first was rejected deliberately — a player who assembles Hussar's genes one genepack at a time ends with a germ that is a Hussar in every way vanilla can measure, whatever they typed last. **Inference only names what vanilla cannot, and the player's templates come first:** before any preset is considered, a template in `Current.Game.customXenotypeDatabase` (the xenotype-editor templates seeded from the scenario's starting pawns and the chosen ideos' xenotype precepts) that matches the genes is the source, whatever its `inheritable` flag, and no preset is considered after it — a player who authored a preset clone and deliberately did not pick the preset has expressed a preference (whatever the reason — an interaction with another mod, say) and the mod does not overrule it. For a *non-inheritable* template the patch only normalises the pawn's name/icon to the template's (the rule a preset match gets): vanilla's xenogene implant is exactly what `PawnIsCustomXenotype` matches such a template against, so the pawn is the template with no help. An *inheritable* template is where the mod earns its keep: `PawnIsCustomXenotype` matches an inheritable template against endogenes, which a xenogene implant never writes, so vanilla cannot deliver it at all — a vanilla implant of the template's own genes yields a pawn merely *named* for it that neither the game, its ideo nor inheritance treats as a member (the 1.0.2 Workshop report: a colony's own germline xenotype bought back from a trader "became xenogenes"). The germline retarget below runs for it exactly as for an inheritable preset, and the identity stays where vanilla put it (`Xenotype` = Baseliner, template name + `IconDef`), so the pawn then resolves to the template by genes. One asymmetry follows: a trader-sold *preset* germ stamps its def via the comp regardless, so in a game holding such a clone a bought germ and its comp-less duplicate diverge — the player's template winning, by design. Such a template can only be authored in the xenotype editor (`Dialog_CreateXenotype`, the on-disk files `Precept_Xenotype`'s picker offers), never at the gene assembler, which saves xenogerm *templates* (`CustomXenogermUtility`), a different file kind that never reaches an ideo or the database. Consequence by design: a hand-assembled gene-for-gene copy of a preset implants as that preset. Gene-less presets are never inferred (an empty germ must not become a Baseliner conversion by accident — that item is only ever made with the comp set). **Pricing reads the raw comp** (`IsTraderSold`: def or `sourceCustomName` set — `XenogermFactory` stamps the template's *name* because a `CustomXenotype` is neither a Def nor `ILoadReferenceable`, so no save-safe reference exists, and a `Scribe_Deep` copy would only snapshot what the live template the pawn is matched against already holds), never the resolver: a copy or a hand-made match implants as the xenotype but is not trader stock, and pricing it as such would make buy-one-duplicate-many a silver printer. For the same reason there is no on-load migration stamping comps onto germs that match a template: identity already resolves by gene set without one, and stamping would turn every duplicate into trader-priced stock. Also skipped: patching the duplicator itself — a foreign-target patch (deferred-application hazard above) that fixes nothing already sitting in saves.

**Germline retarget (default on):** with `Settings.implantGermlineAsEndogenes` (free-standing on purpose: it acts at implant time on items the player already owns, so it must not depend on what the shop grid currently has ticked) a xenogerm resolving to an *inheritable* xenotype (preset def or scenario template; `WillRetargetGermline` is the one decision shared by prefix, postfix and ideology gate) has the pawn's endogenes replaced wholesale by its genes after the identity fields are set (`GeneLayerRebuild.Apply`, also behind the dev-mode reset tool) — what `PawnGenerator` produces for a born member, not a merge (a merge would also let old genes win conflicts: two endogenes resolve by display order, `GeneUtility.Overrides` → `GenesInOrder`, not arrival order). The pawn's own melanin/hair-colour genes are re-added only when the xenotype supplies none — the backfill `PawnGenerator` does with random ones. The pawn's pre-implant *xenogenes* survive the rewrite: a prefix snapshots their defs (vanilla's `SetXenotype(Baseliner)` destroys the instances before the postfix runs) and the retarget re-adds them last — after the colour backfill, because `GetMelaninGene`/`GetHairColorGene` scan all genes and a coloured xenogene would suppress the germline's own backfill. Baseliner is the exception (see below): its conversion wipes both layers, so nothing is snapshotted. **Identity follows the layer that owned it:** vanilla's displayed xenotype describes whichever layer last claimed it (a generated sanguophage with impid `doubleXenotypeChances` endogenes is still labeled Sanguophage), so when the surviving xenogenes owned the pawn's identity — a non-inheritable preset def, or a custom name not matching an inheritable template in `customXenotypeDatabase` (miss ⇒ restore: unmatched names overwhelmingly come from vanilla implants, which write xenogenes) — the prefix also snapshots the identity triple and the postfix restores it instead of stamping: a sanguophage given an impid germline stays a sanguophage. Germline-keyed identities (inheritable preset, plain Baseliner, a `hybrid`-flagged baby still bearing PregnancyUtility's literal "Hybrid" name, inheritable custom template) are stamped over even when stray xenogenes survive. Side effects match a born member: a pawn left with no xenogenes offers no xenogerm extraction; restored xenogenes stay extractable. The retarget (Baseliner conversion included) is skipped entirely — vanilla implant behaviour plus the identity stamp — for a pawn whose endogenes include an `excludeFromXenogermStock` gene: VREA android hardware lives as endogenes with per-instance state, and while VREA's own gates close every shipped implant entry point, this guard keeps the extension's promise for unaudited paths (defense in depth).

**Deathrest-capacity carryover (default on):** `Settings.preserveDeathrestCapacity` restores a pawn's deathrest capacity after any operation that recreates its deathrest gene — vanilla always re-adds genes by def and `Gene_Deathrest.PostAdd` unconditionally resets capacity to 1, discarding the serum investment (~1000+ silver each). Unlike everything else in the implant patch it is not gated on the item being trader-sold: `DeathrestCapacityCarryover` snapshots before / restores after both `ImplantXenogermItem` (any xenogerm) and `ReimplantXenogerm` (the sanguophage ability; the *recipient's* own prior capacity, never the caster's). Restore uses max semantics (`OffsetCapacity` only when below the snapshot) so a deathrest endogene that survived untouched is left alone, and no-ops when no deathrest gene remains (e.g. Baseliner conversion). Capacity only, deliberately: building rebinding is free, and generic modded-gene state carryover (ExposeData round-trips outside a load pass) is a save-corruption hazard.

**Ideology preferred-xenotype gate (always on):** vanilla's `Xenogerm.PawnIdeoDisallowsImplanting` (float menu, target picker, `Dialog_SelectXenogerm`) only asks whether the pawn's ideo holds a precept unwilling to `BecomeNonPreferredXenotype` — it never inspects the germ, because a vanilla xenogerm can only yield a custom xenotype, never a preferred preset. So any ideo with a preferred xenotype refused every xenogerm, including a trader-sold germ for that very xenotype. `Xenogerm_PawnIdeoDisallowsImplanting_Patch` postfixes it with the same exception vanilla already gives the sanguophage reimplant ability (`PawnIdeoCanAccept` allows a preferred caster): the ban is lifted when `PreferredXenotypeGate.ImplantYieldsPreferred` predicts a preferred post-implant identity — a resolved preset def in `Ideo.PreferredXenotypes`, or a germ whose `passOnDirectly` gene set equals a template in `Ideo.PreferredCustomXenotypes` whose `inheritable` flag names the layer the genes will land on (inheritable iff `WillRetargetGermline`), which is exactly how `Pawn_GeneTracker.CustomXenotype`/`GeneUtility.PawnIsCustomXenotype` will resolve the pawn afterwards (by genes, never by `xenotypeName`; endogenes for an inheritable template, xenogenes otherwise). The precept's separate `PropagateBloodfeederGene` refusal is re-derived and left in force.

**Baseliner xenogerm:** Baseliner is `XenotypeEligibility.IsCandidate`'s one gene-less exception and is pinned first in every pool (`InDisplayOrder`, shared by grid and debug spawner). It gates as *inheritable* (`GatesAsInheritable`) despite `inheritable=false` on the def, because its implant always rewrites the germline — so it groups under the germline filter row and seeds unsold by default like the inheritable xenotypes. Its empty xenogerm is the baseliner-conversion item: vanilla implantation wipes all xenogenes unconditionally (`SetXenotype` clears before consulting the empty gene list — verified safe end-to-end, no gene-count gate in the float-menu/bill/recipe chain), and the patch always runs the germline retarget for it regardless of the setting (no genes means no "keep as xenogenes" alternative for the setting to choose; skin/hair colour survives via the retarget's own backfill). Prices at base + `basePresetValue` (no gene stats).

### Key Patterns

**Harmony Patching:** All patches use `[HarmonyPatch]` attributes for automatic discovery via `Harmony.PatchAll()`.

**Pricing via StatParts:** Market value and sell factor are calculated dynamically using `StatPart` classes rather than fixed values. This allows xenogerm prices to reflect their gene composition. Only xenogerms with `CompXenotypeSource.sourceXenotype != null` get premium pricing — player-crafted xenogerms retain the base 20 silver value.

**Stock Generation:** `StockGenerator_Xenogerms` is injected into trader defs via XML patches. It queries `DefDatabase<XenotypeDef>` at generation time, filtering through `XenotypeEligibility.IsSellable` and weighting spawn probability by the settings-chosen `XenogermCommonality` strategy (default: inverse root, 1/√price; all strategies are stateless and pool-relative — the bell curve centres on the pool's median). The per-visit count comes from the settings' per-trader override (`traderCountRanges`, keyed by `StockGenerator.trader.defName`), falling back to the generator's XML `countRange` — the shipped default lives only in the XML patches, nothing is written onto defs, so count changes need no restart.

**Tradeability guard (`XenogermTradeability`):** vanilla's `ThingSetMaker_TraderStock.Generate` (the one consumer behind ships, caravans and settlements) silently discards any generated item whose def fails `tradeability.TraderCanSell()`, logging `<trader> generated carrying Xenogerm... which can't be sold by traders. Ignoring...`. GTG Trader Core's `ThingDefs_Misc_Biotech.xml` patches the vanilla Xenogerm def (default `All`) to `Sellable`, which fails that check, so every germ the generator yielded was thrown away (the 2026-10-03 Workshop report). GTG only lifts the ban, temporarily, for its own extension-flagged traders whose generators implement its `IGTGTC_TradeExemption`; vanilla exotic traders never qualify and load order cannot help. `EnsureTraderCanSell` restores `All` whenever `TraderCanSell` is false, unconditionally, logging one line only when it actually changes the value. It runs from a `[StaticConstructorOnStartup]` class *and* from every `GenerateThings` call: the value lives on the def instance, and a mid-session play-data reload re-patches defs behind the static ctor's back (the def-instance caveat in `XenotypeLedgerStartup`). Safe with GTG because its hijack only acts on defs that are not trader-sellable, so `All` makes it a no-op rather than a fight over the field. The pure decision (`Normalise`) is unit-tested.

**Per-xenotype filtering (sold ledger):** `XenotypeEligibility` is the only place that decides whether a xenotype is sellable; both the generator and the settings grid read it. The state is an explicit per-xenotype sold ledger on settings (`soldXenotypes` by defName, `soldCustomXenotypes` by `CustomXenotype.name`). A xenotype the ledger has never seen gets its entry from `SeedUnseen`: the majority sold state of its category peers (categories are DISJOINT, first match of player-scenario > archite > inheritable > plain), ties falling back to the shipped default — germline-rewriting xenotypes (`GatesAsInheritable`) unsold, everything else sold. An empty ledger makes every vote tie, which is exactly the shipped defaults; `ResetToDefaults` just clears the ledger and lets the next seed pass do the rest. Seeding runs at startup (`XenotypeLedgerStartup`; once per process is deliberate — entries are name-keyed, so an in-process play-data reload can't invalidate them, see the comment there), from the settings grid and from stock generation (the custom pool is per-game). Entries for xenotypes no longer loaded stay dormant — never consulted, never voting, never pruned — so a temporarily disabled mod keeps its choices. The category rows above the grid are pure derivations of the ledger: a tri-state `Widgets.CheckboxMulti` summary (on = all sold / partial = mixed / off = none) that bulk-writes its whole group on click; grid cells are always interactive, drawing dimmed when unsold. Never read the ledger directly from generation code.

**Non-organic genelines (`GeneExtension`):** vanilla has no "organic humanlike" concept — `canGenerateInGeneSet=false` sits on Core hair-colour endogenes (Impid/Waster/Highmate would vanish) and `selectionWeight=0` on Hemogenic (Sanguophage) — so exclusion is an explicit gene-level marker. Any xenotype, preset or custom, containing a gene whose `GeneExtension.excludeFromXenogermStock` is true fails `IsCandidate` and is hidden from the grid outright (not greyed: no setting can restore it). Gene-level because Vanilla Races Expanded - Android's custom "android projects" land in `Current.Game.customXenotypeDatabase` at game start with no Def to patch. `Patches_VREAndroid.xml` flags VREA's two abstract gene bases (XML inheritance appends child `<li>` lists onto the parent's, so every derived gene inherits it, including other mods' `VREA_HardwareBase` children). Other mods opt out with the same `<modExtensions>` snippet.

### Pricing Formula

```
MarketValue = 20 (base) + basePresetValue + (|metabolism| × valuePerMetabolism) + (complexity × valuePerComplexity) + (archites × valuePerArchite)
SellPriceFactor = 0.05 (base) + (archites × 0.035)
```

Default pricing settings:
- `basePresetValue`: 1300 (range: 0-5000)
- `valuePerMetabolism`: 10 (range: 0-100)
- `valuePerComplexity`: 15 (range: 0-100)
- `valuePerArchite`: 100 (range: 0-1000)

The settings grid previews the *shelf price*, `MarketValue × 1.4` (`XenogermPricing.VanillaBuyMarkup` — vanilla's flat buying markup, hardcoded in `TradeUtility.GetPricePlayerBuy`), because in a trader-stock context players read the preview as what they'll pay; the info card keeps raw MarketValue. The cell tooltip's breakdown closes with market value → +40% (buying, shown as the silver it adds so white rows stay additive and yellow rows are the subtotals) → final price, reusing the vanilla trade-tooltip language keys (no XTS strings). Negotiator/settlement bonuses only ever discount from there; faction goodwill never affects vanilla prices.

## Testing

`Tests/1.6/` holds an xUnit (net472) suite for the pure logic: `XenogermPricing` breakdown/market-value math, settings defaults/`ResetToDefaults`, the `XenogermCommonality` spawn-weight strategies, the `PreferredXenotypeGate` prediction and `XenogermIdentity.InferPreset`. Tests are headless — no live game context (`GeneDef`s are built uninitialized via `FormatterServices`); anything needing `DefDatabase`/`Current.Game` is out of scope. Run natively with `dotnet test Tests/1.6/XenogermTraderStock.Tests.csproj` — vstest hosts the net472 suite via mono. If a run fails with `BadImageFormatException`/`TypeLoadException`, a DLL is missing from the test csproj copy target (see the Assembly-CSharp-firstpass comment there): mono resolves field types eagerly where the Windows CLR is lazy. CI builds the Tests project but does not run it.

**Startup smoke test (pre-release):** `python3 Scripts/integration-smoke-test.py` (game closed) boots the *deployed* copy of the mod on its pinned minimal list (Biotech plus VEF core + Vanilla Races Expanded - Android, so `Patches_VREAndroid.xml`'s `FindMod` branch actually executes) — it does not build, and only `-c Release` builds deploy, so run the Release build first or it silently tests the previous DLL. It then classifies Player.log errors by origin and fails on anything attributed to this mod. Run before every release (wired into the release skill); thin shim over the shared engine in `l10n/smoke/` (born from the BetterTradersGuild v1.1.0 CWTL incident).

## Localization

English (`1.6/Languages/English/Keyed/XTS_UI.xml`, `XTS_` prefix) is the source of truth. The pipeline is shared with the sibling mod repos (`../UniqueMeleeWeapons`, `../UniqueWeaponsUnbound`, `../PersonaWeaponsUnbound`, `../BetterTradersGuild`):

- **Shared l10n toolkit (`l10n/` submodule):** the family-wide translation process, per-language mechanics references, cross-language lessons, Workshop conventions, and the checker/refresh script engines live in the `rimworld-l10n` repo, consumed here as the `l10n/` git submodule (canonical working checkout: `~/dev/rimworld-l10n`). `Scripts/check-translations.py` and `Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py` are thin per-repo config shims over its engines. If `l10n/` is empty, run `git submodule update --init`. Never edit `l10n/` in place here: mod-independent learnings go upstream in the canonical checkout; mod-specific learnings go in this repo's skill/glossary. Upstream ships as semver release tags (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; a major means this repo's shim or flow needs an edit), and the pin here moves only at release (release skill step 2), at the start of a translation pass, or when a new major lands, never per upstream commit, so `git submodule status` names the pinned tag and a stable repo's log stays free of pin bumps.
- `python3 Scripts/check-translations.py [--strict]` — deterministic validator (key/placeholder parity, `<!-- EN: ... -->` staleness comments, DefInjected paths, file hygiene). Run by the `translate` and `release` skills and as a CI release gate.
- `Scripts/expected-injections.json` — checked-in sidecar of every DefInjected key the live game expects for this mod; regenerated by `python3 Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py` (boots RimWorld with a pinned mod list via the L10nProbe dev mod — source now lives at `l10n/probe/`; build/deploy it only from the canonical `~/dev/rimworld-l10n` checkout — then restores `ModsConfig.xml`; refuses while the game is open). Currently empty: this mod ships no Defs of its own, only patches.
- **Probe DLC set:** the probe boots with Biotech active (`CANONICAL_ACTIVE_MODS` in the refresh script); the checker's `REQUIRED_DLCS` rejects a sidecar generated without it, since gated defs would drop out of the dump and their shipped translations would turn illegal.
- The `translate` skill's `.claude/skills/translate/glossary/` holds this mod's own coined-term files; per-language grammar/mechanics knowledge now lives upstream in `l10n/languages/<Language>.md`. CONTRIBUTING.md carries the public roster (nine machine-assisted languages plus English) and must move in the same commit as any language change.
- **Workshop title coupling:** each language's `XTS_SettingsCategory` Keyed value is the localized Steam Workshop title and must equal the title line (line 1) of `.steamworkshop/Description/<Language>.txt` — always change the two together (English keeps `Xenogerm Trader Stock` in both).
- **Policy:** translation generation passes run only on explicit request (they are token-expensive). Infra/tooling changes are always fine.

## Linting

Roslynator.Analyzers runs on every build (warnings only, never fails the build; `PrivateAssets=all` so nothing ships). Severities are pinned in `.editorconfig`, which also enforces PascalCase public members (fields excluded — RimWorld's `Scribe_Values.Look` relies on camelCase field names) and the no-XML-doc-comments convention (plain `//` only). Formatting-only sweeps are registered in `.git-blame-ignore-revs`.

## Save Compatibility

- **Adding mid-game**: New xenogerms appear at traders. Existing xenogerms work normally.
- **Removing mid-game**: CompXenotypeSource data ignored on load. Xenogerms remain valid with stored genes. Implantation gives custom xenotype (graceful fallback).
- **XenotypeDef removed**: `Scribe_Defs.Look` returns null. Xenogerm keeps genes, implants as custom xenotype.

## Debugging

**Dev-mode tools (`XenogermDebugActions`, debug menu category "Xenogerm Trader Stock"):** *Spawn preset xenogerm* places a trader-style germ for any preset or scenario template at the cursor. *Reset genes to scenario xenotype* is a pawn tool: click a pawn, then pick a `CustomXenotype` **by name** from `Current.Game.customXenotypeDatabase` — nothing is inferred from the pawn's genes, the player must see and choose the template — and the pawn is rebuilt as a generated member of it (inheritable ⇒ germline, else xenogenes over a colour-only germline; tracker at Baseliner + template name/icon so `PawnIsCustomXenotype` matches). Fills vanilla's gap: the genes-tab Devtool "Reset genes to base xenotype" hides for any `UniqueXenotype` and resets to `genes.Xenotype`, a def, so a custom-identity pawn has no reset. It is also the one-click repair for pawns hit by the pre-1.0.3 xenogene implant of an inheritable scenario germ.

Use the `rimworld-logs` skill — it covers Player.log locations (Windows/WSL/Linux), the `[Xenogerm Trader Stock]` log prefix (the mod display name, as vanilla uses for patch/def errors about the mod), and API disassembly (`monodis`/`ilspycmd` against the live install's `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, preferred over the `Krafs.Rimworld.Ref` CI fallback).

## Harmony Patch Examples

**Postfix Pattern:**

```csharp
[HarmonyPatch(typeof(TargetClass), nameof(TargetClass.MethodName))]
public static class TargetClass_MethodName_Postfix
{
    [HarmonyPostfix]
    public static void Postfix(TargetClass __instance, ref ReturnType __result)
    {
        // __instance: object method was called on
        // __result: return value (modifiable with ref)
    }
}
```

**Prefix Pattern (for skipping original):**

```csharp
[HarmonyPrefix]
public static bool Prefix(ref ReturnType __result)
{
    __result = newValue;
    return false; // Skip original method
}
```

## Key RimWorld APIs

- `XenotypeDef` — Preset xenotype definition with gene list
- `Xenogerm` — Item storing genes (inherits `GeneSetHolderBase`)
- `GeneSet.AddGene()` — Add gene to xenogerm
- `Pawn_GeneTracker.SetXenotypeDirect()` — Set xenotype field without modifying genes
- `DefDatabase<XenotypeDef>.AllDefsListForReading` — All loaded xenotypes
- `Current.Game.customXenotypeDatabase` — Player-scenario xenotypes (the custom xenotypes the starting pawns carried in; filled by `GameInitData.PrepForMapGen`)
